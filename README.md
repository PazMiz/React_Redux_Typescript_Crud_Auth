# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Django Backend Setup
This repository contains the backend code for a Django-based application. Below are the steps to set up the Django backend on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
pip (Python package manager)
Installation
Install Django:
bash
Copy code
pip install django
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-backend.git
cd django-backend
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root of the project directory with the following content:
makefile
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]
Make sure to replace your_django_secret_key with a secure random string that will be used by Django to sign cookies and other security-related features.

Configure the database:

By default, this backend is set up to use SQLite as the database. If you want to use a different database, update the DATABASES setting in the settings.py file accordingly.
Running the Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
